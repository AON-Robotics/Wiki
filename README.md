# VEX-U High Stakes 2025 Competition Repository

## Overview
This repository contains all the code used for the VEX-U High Stakes 2025 competition, including both the operator-controlled and autonomous period programs. The code is built using the **PROS (Purdue Robotics Operating System) framework** and incorporates **OkapiLib** for motion control and path planning.

## Features
- **Autonomous Period**: Pre-programmed routines for different strategies.
- **Operator-Controlled Period**: Custom control mappings for optimal driver performance.
- **Sensor Integration**: Utilizing encoders, IMUs, LiDAR sensors, and vision sensors for precise movement.
- **Motion Planning**: OkapiLib implementation for smooth and accurate navigation.
- **Modular Code Structure**: Organized codebase for easy modifications and improvements.
